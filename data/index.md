Welcome to the [gskr.ing](https://github.com/gskring/) webring. A collection of
**personal spaces** maintained by people _who share certain ideas or approaches
to the Internet_. You can also retrieve **the list of RSS/Atom feeds**
associated with the webring using the [OPML file](/opml/ring.opml) or browse the
various sites in [the reader](/u/sno2wman/frame.html) (making it easy to switch
from one site to another).
